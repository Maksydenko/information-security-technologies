<summary><b>üìã Specification:</b></summary>

Create a software implementation of one of two historically important ciphers and one "training" cipher.

The main goal is to familiarize yourself with the Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers while writing the paper.

**What you have to do**: write a code that will allow the user to encrypt a message with one of these ciphers.

It is not regulated in what language or in what format, it is up to you.

**What your program should do**: encrypt and decrypt a text message. The first two ciphers can be in the same program/program block. The text for encryption can be a hymn or "Testament".

For the Caesar cipher, the key/offset value is the date of your work (day, not month).

For the Vigen√®re cipher, you choose the key word/phrase at your own discretion (it can be, for example, your surname).

The gamma cipher involves adding digitized text and a key phrase called a gamma. In this part of the work, you have to encode the text (digitize it). The method of encoding the text and the key is not regulated (you can use the alphabetical letter number, you can use an ANSI table, you can translate the Huffman code into binary form), but it must be commented on in the code or written in the theoretical part of the report. The key is your last name and first name (encoded using the same method as the text) + the date of the work (day and month), written in one line without spaces.
